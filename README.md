# Acrylic_Mech_Keyboard
I laser cut a 40% ortholinear mechanical keyboard, so here I am hosting the laser cut files used to create this.

It is fairly important to note that I used 5mm thick acrylic to yield an internal height of 10mm, which I deemed sufficient to contain the handwiring of the keyboard.

I designed this layout a few years ago, but I still believe the design to be relatively sound, although you may want to slightly alter the switch plate design since I ended up hot-gluing my switches into the plate to reinforce them, since they were prone to popping out.
